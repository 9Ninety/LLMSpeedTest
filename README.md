A web application for measuring and comparing the output speed of Large Language Models (LLMs).

## Overview

LLM Speed Test provides an easy way to benchmark the performance of different language models. It measures key metrics like:

- **Tokens Per Second (TPS)**: How fast the model generates text
- **Time To First Chunk**: How long it takes to receiving the first chunk of response
- **Total Response Time**: Overall duration from request to completion
- **Token Count**: Number of tokens in the generated response

Perfect for developers, researchers, and enthusiasts who need to compare LLM performance across different models or API endpoints.

## Features

- ðŸš€ Run speed tests against OpenAI and compatible API endpoints
- ðŸ“Š Collect and display performance metrics
- ðŸ”„ Compare results across multiple tests
- ðŸ’¾ Locally save test results and configurations
- ðŸ“± Responsive design for desktop and mobile
- ðŸŒ“ Light/dark mode support
